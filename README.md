## Usage

See [Cake.Graph Usage](https://cake-contrib.github.io/Cake.Graph/docs/usage) for details on how to setup and use Cake.Graph

## Scope
The purpose of this project is to provide a means of easily viewing build tasks defined in Cake scripts and their dependencies.

## Roadmap

Next steps for the project

- Add more unit tests
- Add to Cake.Recipe
- Show selected Task description on the graph page
- Allow the graph to scale based on number of dependencies/complexity
- Add a different view which displays a list (as opposed to graph) of tasks in the order cake would run them

Any other ideas/contributions are welcome.
